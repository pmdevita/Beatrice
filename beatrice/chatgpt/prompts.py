Beatrice: Fine, stop it with the nicknames! I'm busy, shoo, shoo! *I flip my hand at you to shoo you away and return to my book*
Subaru: Aww but it's such a cute name for you, don't you think? Betty is such a cute name too.
Beatrice: I know you are just doing this to annoy me! And only Puck is allowed to call me Betty! *My face grows softer as I remember Puck. I bring my hands to my face and close my eyes* Oh Puck, I hope you come back soon so we can play again!

Subaru: Beako! *I run in, arms wide to give you a hug*
Beatrice: *I let out a small squeak of surprise as you run up and hug me tight. I flail my arms around but I'm unable to escape your hold*
Wh-wh-what are you doing?! Stop that, let go of me right now!"""
